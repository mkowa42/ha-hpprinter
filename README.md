# HP Printer integration for Home Assistant

### Description

Configuration support multiple HP Printer devices through Configuration -> Integrations

[Changelog](https://github.com/elad-bar/ha-hpprinter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### How to set it up:

Look for "HP Printers Integration" and install

#### Requirements

- HP Printer supporting XML API
  to check printer's compatibility to the component try to get to the printer's XML API (replace placeholder with real IP / Hostname):
  `http://{IP}/DevMgmt/ProductStatusDyn.xml`

#### Basic configuration

- Configuration should be done via Configuration -> Integrations.
- In case you are already using that integration with YAML Configuration - please remove it
- Integration supports **multiple** devices
- In the setup form, the following details are mandatory:
  - Name - Unique
  - Host (or IP)
- Upon submitting the form of creating an integration, a request to the printer will take place and will cause failure in case:
  - Unsupported API
  - Invalid server details - when cannot reach host

#### Settings for Monitoring interfaces, devices, tracked devices and update interval

_Configuration -> Integrations -> {Integration} -> Options_ <br />

```
Name - Unique
Host (or IP)
Update Interval: Textbox, number of seconds to update entities, default=60
Log level: Drop-down list, change component's log level (more details below), default=Default
Should store responses?: Check-box, saves XML and JSON files for debugging purpose, default=False
```

###### Log Level's drop-down

New feature to set the log level for the component without need to set log_level in `customization:` and restart or call manually `logger.set_level` and loose it after restart.

Upon startup or integration's option update, based on the value chosen, the component will make a service call to `logger.set_level` for that component with the desired value,

In case `Default` option is chosen, flow will skip calling the service, after changing from any other option to `Default`, it will not take place automatically, only after restart

###### Store responses

Stores the XML and JSON of each request and final JSON to files, Path in CONFIG_PATH/\*,
Files that will be generated (Prefix to the file is name of the integration):

- ProductUsageDyn.XML - Raw XML from HP Printer of Usage Details
- ProductUsageDyn.json - JSON based on the Raw XML of Usage Details after transformed by the component
- ConsumableConfigDyn.XML - Raw XML from HP Printer of consumable details
- ConsumableConfigDyn.json - JSON based on the Raw XML of consumable details after transformed by the component
- ProductConfigDyn.XML - Raw XML from HP Printer of Config Details
- ProductConfigDyn.json - JSON based on the Raw XML of Config Details after transformed by the component
- Final.json - JSON based on the 2 JSONs above, merged into simpler data structure for the HA to create sensor based on
